# Cataclysm-DDA-Touhou-Mod
This is a fork of Taberone's [Touhou Professions](https://github.com/Taberone/Cataclysm-DDA-Touhou-Mod) mod.

**This mod goes in /data/mods**

To pick any of the characters, you have to select the **Touhou Mod** scenario when creating a new character.


## About the mod
This mod is intended to be some sort of Touhou-flavored conversion for CDDA, inspired by the following questions:
  1) How would your [insert your favorite Touhou] survive during the apocalypse?
  2) What would the Sages do if there was an Outside World "End of the World" scenario, stacked several times upon itself, simultaneously?
  3) What would each faction (Lunarians, Tengu, Underground youkai, SDM, etc.) do, after realizing that there's no status quo anymore?

and more, but those are the most important now.

It greatly expands upon the original, primarily by further developing each existing character with custom spells, clothing, martial arts, special items, etc.

It also adds a lot of stuff from the Touhou series, going from the relatively simple and direct stuff like generic youkai enemies (WIP), to more obscure tidbits of lore such as extinct fauna, to finally stuff that would be fun to have in both a Touhou game and a CDDA mod, like as forgotten firearms and magical items (WIP).

### Characters
* **Fujiwara no Mokou:** Uses fire spells, fights with a custom martial art that increases her damage the more she fights, while also making her more vulnerable.  Sadly not immortal anymore.
* **Hong Meiling:** Uses qi spells, fights using a special form of Tai Chi focused on defense, with windows of opportunity after blocking attacks.  Nap time can't come soon enough.
* **Iku Nagae:** Uses electric spells, fights by whipping and shocking enemies to death, while dancing elegantly on the battlefield.
* **Reisen Udongein Inaba:** Uses wavelength manipulation.  Former member of the Elite Lunarian Defence Corps, proficient with firearms with a touch of medicine at the side.  Starts with a Lunarian tech pistol.
* **Reisen:** Uses a mysterious ability.  Recently conscripted into the Lunarian Defence Corps, fights aided by her service Lunarian rifle, and "basic" military training.  She's trying her best!
* **Reiuji Utsuho:** Uses nuclear spells.  She's half Hell Raven, half sun god, half pet, wholly awesome.
* **Remilia Scarlet:** Uses Red Magic.  The charismatic leader of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, nothing can oppose her when she's serious.
* **Rin Kaenbyou :** Uses destructive fire spells, and calls forth Vengeful spirits to assist her in battle.  Drives a wooden cart powered by her dead enemies
* **Sakuya Izayoi:** Uses time spells, fights by throwing knives and cleaning it elegantly and perfectly up afterwards.
* **Seiga Kaku:** Uses wicked spells, fights without care for human life and norms, all while forcing "collateral damage" victims back to life to fight for her.
* **Shameimaru Aya:** Uses wind spells.  The earnest, most pure, fastest Tengu reporter is always on the look of interesting news.
* **Tenshi Hinanawi:** Uses earth spells.  Very resistant to physical damage, very susceptible to boredom, she wields the Sword of Hisou and fights with a martial art focused on critical attacks over anything else.
* **Youmu Konpaku:** Uses sword techniques.  Also trained in gardening, she wields Roukanken and Hakurouken, two Youkai katana capable of cutting anything!

* Some monsters like the MIB also drop custom items, more are planned to do that in the future (and for different kinds of items).


### Food and recipes

* Vegetables: Satsumaimo (sweet potatoes).
* Each of the new items have their own basic crafting, like roasted bird meat, or boiled arthropod.
* New dishes were also developed, like chicken pie, chicken soup, or paella, among several others.


## WIP
Relatively easy things to add, not in order:
* Professions: Nitori is still not playable.  I want to add Yamame, Kasen and maybe Flandre too.
* Youkai: a lot more.  Skinwalkers, La Llorona, Roc, banshees, plenty of tsukumogami, etc.  
* Items: items that have magical enchantments or special abilities, like the mini hakkero replica, lampad torch were already designed but not implemented.  There's a lot that can be done in this regard, taking TH18 and TH18.5 as reference.
* Locations: Power spots, basically small zones of interest for the player to explore/search, where forgotten items reappear and certain monsters gather, depending on the spot type or surroundings.
* Visual effects: can it be done with fields? For example, when Youmu dashes, cherry petals appear on the path.
* Vehicles: Replace the corpse cart for a wheelbarrow.  Also make the keystone vehicle actually a vehicle.
* Balance: CDDA is a roguelike, but the mod feels RPG-ish at times.


## Milestones
Relatively hard or complex things to add, not in order:
* Even MORE Touhou characters.
* NPCs: generic and important, this includes quests and some story.
* Quests: to give short-medium term goals for the player.
* Story: an overarching story.
* Locations: Reverse-spirited away places from Gensokyo, like an abandoned Hakurei shrine.  These would go from small dungeons (say, a power spot or a haunted house), to city-sized zones (say, an underground city).
* True modding: things that seems currently hardcoded, like new damage types, new resources, spell shapes, new mechanics, etc.
* A species system for both the characters and youkai.  For example, species-restricted traits like flying, percentual resistance (or weakness) to different kinds of damage, etc.
* A toggle at will (or not) between humanoid and youkai/legend form? 
* Spellcards?


## Spoilers

<details>
    <summary>Spoiler (1/2)</summary>
    Current profession descriptions give a initial glimpse of an underlying story. So far, a tl;dr is that certain mastermind youkai is related in some way or another to the Cataclysm, so she played her hand accordingly.  Each character would meet Gensokyan NPCs, or find items, structures or clues in the world, and continue the story from that point.  This is a long term goal after I finish adding and fixing most of the "core" mod.

        Certain 2hu fan work matches the first D of CDDA almost perfectly
