The gait is simultaneously awkward yet agile. The tail is thick and short, the limbs are robust, with the hind limbs shorter than the front limbs, each of them ends on a feet with short claws, capable of rudimentary grappling.  The huge trapezoidal head displays saber-teeth like fangs. Looking at it forces a primal bubble of fear from the depths of your mind come to the surface, ready to cavitate.",

The gait is unlike anything you have seen before, both awkward yet agile, with the animal running on a similar way you'd imagine a crocodile can. The tail is thick and short, the weirdly human-looking limbs sprawl at the sides, each of them ends on feet with short claws.  The most shocking part of the animal is the very robust, huge, flat trapezoidal head, with equally huge fangs showing well past the lips.  You think, you know deep inside you a bite will really hurt.",
