---------
DONE SO FAR (by Taberone):
---------

- Youmu Konpaku (Custom dress/accessory)
- Seiga (Custom dress/accessory)
- Reisen (Custom business suit, holster, bionics, guns)
- Tenshi (Custom mutation, dress, hat, sword)
- Sakuya (Nothing custom added, vanilla content so far)
- Rei'sen/Reisen II (Reisen's business suit, Lunar Rifle)
- Iku (Custom shirt, skirt, weaponized scarf, hat)
- Fujiwara No Mokou (Fireproof talismans that sorta work, starts with a custom mutation that gives Taekwondo)


---------
DON'T KNOW HOW/UNSURE HOW TO:
---------

-Reisen's (Udonge) eye effect (No idea)
	Done: three different spells that give different buffs

- Acceptable stats for any clothing or weaponry added by this mod (Lots of copy/pastes with some stuff changed but it's still almost-identical)
	Done: most girls have custom clothing, Reisen wears her Lunar Defense Corps uniform, Mokou's clothes (are supposed to) don't burn

- "Balancing"/"Fun" (Some professions might feel too identical or just not fun to play, etc)
	Half-done: added a bunch of spells to try make each girl and playstile different from each other, but it's not balanced and not finished

- Seiga's hairstick cutting through walls
	Previously done by Taberone

- Yagokoro Lab location w/ clones of certain Touhou characters as enemies
	- Sorta like a Science Lab except with Touhou stuff
	- Enemies: Clones of Reisen Udongein Inaba, Rei'sen, Tewi, Eirin Yagokoro, etc


---------
CAN DO (Eventually):
---------

Mokou profession (Lots and lots of fire)
-Mokou's profession trait possibly needs a custom martial art
	Half-done: she fights by greatly increasing her combat capabilities but also reducing her defensive stats, it's not balanced yet
-Sashinuki Hakama (Mokou's pants according to Touhou Wiki) still needs to be added?
	Previously done by Taberone, tweaked
-Maybe add in a bionic flamethrower for Mokou
	Previously done by Taberone, later removed due using Magyclism spells
-Mokou's Flamethrower spawns with ammo already loaded
	Previously done by Taberone, later removed due using Magyclism spells


Youmu tweaks:
-Youmu's dress divided into separate pieces (Shirt/Vest/Dress?) instead of an all-in-one dress
	Previously done by Taberone, tweaked
-Youmu gets her named weapons instead of the generic vanilla swords and either Niten is modded to include them too, or a new martial arts style that's Niten on steroids is added that includes them
	Done: added both named weapons and the custom martial art


Rei'sen tweaks:
- Something inbetween Finger Laser CBM (Weak) and Finger Gun CBM (Strong and powerful). Maybe the Finger Gun CBM but without burst fire and an increased power cost.
	Changed: removed CBMs (old JSON blocks is still there), tweaked her service rifle to use ammo crafted from mana, but ideally it should drain mana to shoot
- Lunar Rifle butchering? It has a bayonet.


Various things:
- Eirin profession (Master archery/first aid/other?)

- Byakuren and/or Meiling profession (Punch/kick everything to death)
	Done, Meiling added

- Aya profession (Really fast runner)
	Done, Aya added (WIP)

- Nitori profession (master crafter)

- Renko and Maribel (Relatively normal compared to the others)

- Kogasa (Surprise people somehow, possibly cloaking. Should also come with a blade hidden in an umbrella?)

- Yuyuko profession

- Eiki Shiki


---------
MIGHT DO:
---------

- Custom Sakuya knives? Knife throwing bionic?
	Done: Sakuya has custom knives, can craft temporary knives with a spell
