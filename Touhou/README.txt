Things that needs fixing (v 0.9.0.5)
1. Seems like dashing from a rooftop to another doesn't move the character through the air, instead they drop to the ground taking damage and then climb back up to their intended position
2. The new HEART part
3. Throw Gungnir spell works almost as intended, but Remi is able to cast it twice before Gugngir is consumed
4. Also, the Gungnir explosion effect gives an error about item components
