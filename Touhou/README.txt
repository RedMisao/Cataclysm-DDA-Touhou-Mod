Things that needs fixing (v 0.9.0.8)
1. 'Casting' dashes from a rooftop to another doesn't move the character horizontally through the air, instead they drop to the ground taking damage and then climb back up to their intended position, other than that they seem to work properly
2. Throw Gungnir spell works almost as intended, however Remi is able to cast it twice before Gungnir is consumed
3. Can't parse c_gray color (?) this is probably from a vehicle part or vehiclepart item
4. Kaenbyou's Vengeful spirit release seems to do no damage to enemies, use at your own risk
5. Corpses as fuel is not working, so Kaenbyou's wheelbarrow is not working in this version
