Things that needs fixing (v 0.9.1.2c)
1. 'Casting' dashes from a rooftop to another doesn't move the character horizontally through the air, instead they drop to the ground taking damage and then climb back up to their intended position. Reisen's dash also doesn't teleport her past walls. Other than that, they seem to work properly
2. Throw Gungnir spell works almost as intended, however Remi is able to cast it twice before Gungnir is consumed
3. Kaenbyou's Vengeful spirit release seems to do no damage to enemies, use at your own risk (Fix pending pending)
4. Utsuho's Fusion blade is currently not working
5. Implement spawning zones for the new (extinct) animals and youkai
6. Human and Zombie harvest needs fixing
