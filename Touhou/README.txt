Things that needs fixing (v 0.9.2.4)
1. 'Casting' dashes from a rooftop to another doesn't move the character horizontally through the air, instead they drop to the ground taking damage and then climb back up to their intended position. Reisen's dash also doesn't teleport her past walls. Other than that, they seem to work properly
2. Throw Gungnir spell works almost as intended, however Remi is able to cast it twice before Gungnir is consumed
3. Kaenbyou's Vengeful spirit release now "works" I think, need to confirm this
4. Utsuho's Fusion blade is currently not working
5. Some animals are not spawning, this is because I'm adding them to the mapgen files. Also, I'm expecting for their spawn to be excessive or very limited, so things like multiple Beasts of GÃ©vaudan are theoretically possible, but not intended
