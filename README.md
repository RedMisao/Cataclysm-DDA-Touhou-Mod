# Cataclysm-DDA-Touhou-Mod
**Original by Taberone**

This branch is for untested additions that produce non-critical errors when running the mod. Read:
* This mod's version is *technically* stable but don't proper functionality in-game and expect even less balance
* There is more content than master but such content is expected to not work

----

**Changelog over the master branch**
* Spells: basic dashes, Remi's and Okuu's dashes, summoning a weapon (Gungnir) and consuming it with another spell, some fusion-themed spells for Utsuho (NOT TESTED), Mokou's aoe kick + knockback (NOT TESTED)
* Items: Sakuya's "special knife" (it's just a modified combat knife), silver knives
* Misc: In process of changing as many bionics into spells as I can
* Vehicles: Kaenbyou's wheelbarrow (uses diesel for now)
