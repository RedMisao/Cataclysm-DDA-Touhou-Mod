# Cataclysm-DDA-Touhou-Mod
**Original by Taberone**

This branch is for untested additions that produce non-critical errors when running the mod. **Read:** the contents are *technically* stable but don't expect proper functionality in-game

----

**Changelog over the master branch**
* Mod updated to 2021-12-23 experimental
* A very barebones Aya. She has some custom items, some generic Tengu items, and one spell with a crowd control component (none tested so far)
* Spells: Tenshi's keystone crash (without the actual keystone yet)
* Items: Satsumaimo (sweet potato), including seeds and some recipes. Holsters for Sakuya's knives, Youmu's swords and their holsters
* Test items (not spawning yet) like an electric mini hakkero replica, a Tengu sword and a shield, a LDF riot shield, guns (M76 Zastava, SIG 550 and 550-1, StG 44, SVD, VSS) with their ammo if needed, magazines and two gun mods, heavenly peaches
* Reordered lots of .json lines, nothing really important
