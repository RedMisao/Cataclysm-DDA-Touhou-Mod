For a full list of the mod's contents, see the original repo

----

**Mod's contents, including changes over the original**

**Professions (Touhou characters)**
* Hourai incarnate, Oarfish messenger, Hell's traffic accident, Lunatic Moon Rabbit and Moon Rabbit Recruit, Scarlet Devil, Maid of the Scarlet Devil, Wicked Hermit, Crow Tengu Journalist, Celestial Delinquent, Subterranean sun, Phantom Gardener

* Generic firearms: M76 Zastava, IDW, SIG 550 and 550-1, StG 44, SVD, VSS, including their ammo, casings and magazines if needed
* Gunmods, like scopes (PSO-1, ON-M76 and SUSAT, mostly flavor), elongated pistol barrels, a stock, a bipod and an 'experimental' grip that turns the IDW (plus pistols and SMGs) into a fist weapon


**Spells.**

Currently most of them are an attempt to adapt those from the fighting games, some examples are:

* Remilia's Gungnir, Mokou's blazing kick, Kaenbyou's friendly vengeful spirits, Sakuya's time manipulation, Tenko's keystone impact, Utsuho's hell wave cannon and a basic nuke
* Dashes, including some custom dashes for some girls


**Bionics:**
* Finger Burst, Finger Gun (both currently deactivated)
* Remilia's vessels for blood storage


**Clothing:**
* Gyokuto uniform set (despite the looks it's proper combat-grade armor)
* A lot of custom clothing such as dresses, ribbons, hats, shoes, holsters, etc. depending on the character


**Other items and changes:**
* Lampreys, lamprey meat and recipes
* Satsumaimo (sweet potato), including recipes
* Chicken meat from chickens, also recipes


----

**Current WIP**
* Professions: each girl should have a distinct feeling and focus, without forcing the player into that specific 'role'
* Weapons: Add functionality for the Third leg and Tengu fan, add more Touhou related items
* Items: Some items, like a Tengu shield, sword, LDF riot shield, a mini hakkero replica were added but not yet implemented in-game
* Spells: Each girl should have at least 3 different spells, not including dashes or their special ability or trademark. The biggest issue with these is how to make them have personality and utility
* Clothing: Coverage values, crafting recipes, repair requirements, etc
* Locations: Mystery spots where 'forgotten items' reappear and certain monsters gather, basically priority zones for the player to explore/search
* Materials: Existing (and new) items that need specific materials, such as Former hell, Celestial, Tengu stuff
* Monsters: enemies, passive (non-aggressive). Extinct animals?
* Vehicles: Corpse cart details. The vehicle itself works but not as intended
* Other items: Corpse furnace, hydrogen extractor/purificator


***Planned at some point***
* Professions: Gatekeeper of the Devil, Friendly youkai of the cave, Sister of the Devil
* Weapons: Mini Hakkero, Laevateinn, more than one spell per use_action
* Clothing: too many too mention, i.e. Elite LDC armor
* Locations: Reverse-spirited away places from Gensokyo, PC visiting different 'worlds' related to Gensokyo
* Materials: Ideally, exotic materials should have special properties, other than just number changes
* Mutations: some kind of "species" system of the various existing youkai, species-restricted traits
* NPCs: generic and important
* Story: long term goal is to add an overarching story (see spoilers below)
* Other: plenty of interesting stuff with spells, damage, mutations. These seem hardcoded so I need to look into it
* Not sure where it goes: toggle between humanoid and youkai/legend form, their most common spellcards in some form

    <summary>Spoiler (1/2)</summary>
    Current profession descriptions give a initial glimpse of an underlying story. So far, a tl;dr is that certain mastermind youkai is related in some way or another to the Cataclysm, so she played her hand accordingly. Each profession would then meet Gensokyo's NPCs or find items or structures in the world, and continue the story from that point. Again, this is a long term goal after I finish adding and fixing most of the "core" mod

        <summary>Spoiler (2/2)</summary>
        I think certain 2hu fan work matches the first D of CDDA almost perfectly
