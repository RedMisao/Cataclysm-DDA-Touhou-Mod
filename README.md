# Cataclysm-DDA-Touhou-Mod
**Original by Taberone**

This branch is for testing (and save) changes over the master branch that produce non-critical errors. It means, this mod's version is *technically* stable but don't expect balance or intended functionality.

**Changelog over the master branch**
* Spells: basic dashes, Scarlet's Devil and Subterranean sun's dashes, summoning Gungnir into battle, some fusion-themed spells for Utsuho
