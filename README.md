# Cataclysm-DDA-Touhou-Mod
**Original by Taberone**

This branch is for untested additions that produce non-critical errors when running the mod.

**Read:** the contents are *technically* stable but don't expect proper functionality in-game

**Changelog over the master branch (0.9.2.4)**
* Generic oni enemies added, with their drop, species and harvest (not spawning yet)
* Added dual kanabo for oni
* MIB drops corrected
