**Mod's contents, including changes from the original**

**Professions:**
* **Fujiwara no Mokou:** Uses fire based magic with a custom martial art that increases her damage the more she fights, but also makes her more vulnerable
* **Hinanawi Tenshi:** Very resistant to physical damage, she wields the Sword of Hisou, by fighting with a martial art focused on critical attacks over defense
* **Hong Meiling:** Loyal gatekeeper that fights a special form of Tai Chi focused on defense, with windows of opportunity after blocking attacks. Has some spells and attacks based on qi manipulation
* **Iku Nagae (WIP):** Sent down from Heaven, she whips and shocks enemies to death while dancing in the battlefield
* **Kaku Seiga:** Disregarding human life and norms, she forces "collateral damage victims" back to life to fight for her
* **Kaenbyou Rin:** Uses fire spells and calls forth Vengeful spirits to assist her in battle, drives a wooden cart powered by her dead enemies
* **Konpaku Youmu:** Trained in gardening and swordfighting, she wields two Youkai katana capable of cutting anything!
* **Reisen Udongein Inaba:** Proficient with firearms with a touch of medicine at the side, she uses a Lunarian tech pistol and some Moon rabbit armor from her former days as part of the elite fighting force of the Lunarians
* **Reisen:** Recently conscripted, she has "basic" training with military weapons, defending herself with her service Lunarian rifle. She's trying her best!
* **Reiuji Utsuho:** Half Hell Raven, half sun god, half pet, she melts her enemies hard enough not even ashes remain
* **Remilia Scarlet:** The charismatic leader of the Mansion and user of Red Magic, nothing can oppose her when she's serious
* **Sakuya Izayoi:** Loyal head maid, she manipulates time in order to fight
* **Shameimaru Aya:** (WIP)


**Spells:**

* Remilia's Gugnir, Sakuya's time manipulation, Utsuho's hell wave cannon and a basic nuke, etc. Every character has at least one custom spell
* Dashes, including some custom dashes for some girls


**Martial arts:**
* Celestial brawling for Iku, and Tenko, modified Tai Chi for Meiling, new styles for Mokou and Youmu
* Each of those have their own styles and techniques, derived from the fighting games and some spellcards


**Weapons:**
* Iku's scarf, Lunarian weapons for the Gyokuto, Sakuya's knives, Tenko's summonable sword, Youmu's swords, Remilia's summonable Gugnir
* Generic firearms: M76 Zastava, IDW, SIG 550 and 550-1, StG 44, SVD, VSS, including their ammo, casings and magazines if needed
* Gunmods, like scopes (PSO-1, ON-M76 and SUSAT, mostly flavor), elongated pistol barrels, a stock, a bipod and an 'experimental' grip that turns the IDW (plus pistols and SMGs) into a fist weapon


**Monsters (WIP):**
* **Youkai:** Chupacabra, Beast of Gévaudan, jinmenken, kunekune
* **Cryptids and urban legends:** Enfield horror, nightcrawler, Mongolian death worm, Sasquatch, Yeti, MIBs

* Not all of them are spawning yet, or spawning as they should

These have generic attacks such as bites, slashes, some use specific spells
A few of them are passive or neutral, most of them should be dangerous, none or them are trainable or mountable so far


**Bionics:**
* Remilia's vessels for blood storage
* Finger Burst, Finger Gun (both currently deactivated)


**Clothing:**
* Every character has their own custom set of clothing, based on the games and art from the official books


**Other items and changes (from the base game and Taberone's base mod):**
* Comestibles (lamprey meat, satsumaimo, bird meat, arthropod meat, shrimplike meat) with few new generic recipes
* Fuel for Seiga's wicked techniques
* New ammo for the new guns, such as 7.92×33mm, 9x39mm, etc
* Lunar guns now consume ammo crafted from mana instead of UPS charges. This is temporary until I figure how to add bio_ups but for mana
* Custom materials, mostly thematic like Lunarian clothing for Gyokuto armor


----

**Current WIP**
* Professions: Iku needs polishing, Nitori is still not playable, everyone needs to have at least 3 spells
* Weapons: Third leg and Tengu fan need functionality, also theres some items left to add such as Laevateinn
* Items: Some items, (Tengu shield, sword, LDF riot shield, a mini hakkero replica, kanabo, Lunarian guns) were added but don't spawn yet
* Spells: The biggest issue with these is how to make them have personality and utility
* Clothing: There is plenty of generic clothing that's not spawning yet, some would need crafting recipes
* Locations: New locations such as mystery spots where 'forgotten items' reappear and certain monsters gather, basically priority zones for the player to explore/search
* Materials: Existing (and new) items that need specific materials, such as Lunarian, Former hell, Celestial, Tengu stuff
* Monsters: more monsters like oni (lesser at least), terror birds, skinwalkers, La Llorona, Roc, banshees, etc
* Effects: New fields are a WIP
* Vehicles: Corpse cart details. The vehicle itself works but not as intended
* Other items: Corpse furnace, hydrogen extractor/purificator


***Planned at some point***
* Professions: Friendly youkai of the cave, Sister of the Devil
* Weapons: Mini Hakkero, Laevateinn
* Clothing: too many too mention, i.e. Elite LDC armor
* Locations: Reverse-spirited away places from Gensokyo, PC visiting different 'worlds' related to Gensokyo
* Materials: Ideally, exotic materials should have special properties, other than just number changes
* Mutations: some kind of "species" system of the various existing youkai, species-restricted traits
* NPCs: generic and important
* Story: long term goal is to add an overarching story (see spoilers below)
* Other: plenty of interesting stuff with spells, damage, mutations. These seem hardcoded so I need to look into it
* Not sure where it goes: toggle between humanoid and youkai/legend form, their most common spellcards in some form

    <summary>Spoiler (1/2)</summary>
    Current profession descriptions give a initial glimpse of an underlying story. So far, a tl;dr is that certain mastermind youkai is related in some way or another to the Cataclysm, so she played her hand accordingly. Each profession would then meet Gensokyo's NPCs or find items or structures in the world, and continue the story from that point. Again, this is a long term goal after I finish adding and fixing most of the "core" mod

        <summary>Spoiler (2/2)</summary>
        I think certain 2hu fan work matches the first D of CDDA almost perfectly
