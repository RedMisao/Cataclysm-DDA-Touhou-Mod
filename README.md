**Mod's contents, including changes over the original**

**Professions (Touhou characters)**
* Oarfish messenger, Hell's traffic accident, Lunatic Moon Rabbit and Moon Rabbit Recruit, Scarlet Devil, Maid of the Scarlet Devil, Celestial Delinquent, Subterranean sun, Phantom Gardener, Wicked Hermit, Hourai incarnate

**Weapons:**
* Iku's scarf, Tenko's sword, Moon rabbit guns, silver knives

Currently most of them are an attempt to adapt those from the fighting games, some examples are:
* Remilia's Gungnir, Mokou's blazing kick, Kaenbyou's friendly vengeful spirits, Sakuya's time manipulation, Utsuho's hell wave cannon and a basic nuke
* Dashes, including some custom dashes for some girls

**Bionics:**
* Finger Burst, Finger Gun

**Clothing:**
* Moon rabbit uniform set (despite its look it's decent armor)
* A lot of clothing items such as dresses, ribbons, hats, shoes for most characters


----

**Current WIP**
* Professions: Aya, Flan
* Weapons: Third leg, Tengu fan, Laevateinn
* Spells: too many too mention, also fix problems with some existing ones
* Clothing: too many too mention
* Materials: Former hell, Celestial, Tengu naterials
* Mutations: some kind of "species" system of the various existing youkai
* Other items: corpse engine, corpse furnace, hydrogen extractor/purificator


***Planned at some point***
* Professions: Friendly youkai of the cave
* Weapons: Mini Hakkero
* Clothing: too many too mention, i.e. Elite LDC armor
* Materials: a realistic (or close to) way to obtain and process the newly introduced materials
* Monsters
* NPCs
* Story: long term goal is to add an overarching story (see spoilers below)
* Other: plenty of interesting stuff with spells, damage, mutations seems hardcoded so I need to look into it
* Not sure where it goes: toggle between humanoid and youkai/legend form, their most common spellcards in some form, famous Gensokyo structures being reverse-spirited away into the generated world...

    <summary>Spoiler (1/2)</summary>
    Current profession descriptions give a initial glimpse of an underlying story. So far, a tl;dr is that certain mastermind youkai is related in some way or another to the Cataclysm, so she played her hand accordingly. Each profession would then meet Gensokyo's NPCs or find items or structures in the world, and continue the story from that point. Again, this is a long term goal after I finish adding and fixing most of the "core" mod

        I think certain 2hu fan work matches the first D of CDDA almost perfectly
