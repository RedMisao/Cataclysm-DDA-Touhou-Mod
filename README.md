* Materials: Lunarian cloth (used for the LDC uniforms)
* Mutations: some kind of "species" system of the various existing youkai


***Planned at some point***
* Professions: Sister of the Devil, Wind god girl, Hell's traffic accident, Friendly youkai of the cave
* Weapons (may go in Bionics): Laevateinn, Tengu fan, Mini Hakkero 
* Bionics: basic spellcasting?, more bionics for each character
* Clothing: more custom clothing for the new professions, maybe special armor such as Elite LDC armor
* Mutations: plenty of interesting stuff seems hardcodded so I need to look into it
* Materials: Celestial cotton, Tengu weave, Netherworld wood, things like that
* Monsters: famous figures of Gensokyo as NPCs (see spoilers below)
* Story: long term goal is to add an overarching story (see spoilers below)
* Not sure where it goes: toggle between humanoid and youkai/legend form, each character's special abilities, their most common spellcards in some form, famous Gensokyo structures being reverse-spirited away into the generated world...

    Current profession descriptions give a initial glimpse of an underlying story. So far, a tl;dr is that certain mastermind youkai is related in some way or another to the Cataclysm, so she played her hand accordingly. Each profession would then meet Gensokyo's NPCs or find items or structures in the world, and continue the story from that point. Again, this is a long term goal after I finish adding and fixing most of the "core" mod

        I think certain 2hu fan work matches the first D of CDDA almost perfectly
