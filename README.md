# Cataclysm-DDA-Touhou-Mod
**Original by Taberone**

This branch is for untested additions that produce non-critical errors when running the mod.

**Read:** the contents are *technically* stable but don't expect proper functionality in-game

**Changelog over the master branch (0.9.2.4):**
* Generic oni enemies added, with their files (harvest, species, drops, etc)
* New weapons featuring three kinds of kanabo (mostly for oni so far), PGM Hécate, some Lunarian weaponry for experimental purposes
