# Cataclysm-DDA-Touhou-Mod
**Feel free to fork this mod and do whatever you want with it, I guess. I haven't been too active with modding CDDA recently. Just credit me if you make a fork of this.**

**This mod goes in data/mods. Magiclysm is required.**

Contains new professions based off of Touhou, a special scenario with the Touhou professions and less limits on where to start, and new clothing/weapons/profession traits/etc specifically made for certain professions. This mod is considered unfinished, but functional.

Playing as a male survivor will only change the underwear (Boxers instead of panties) and nothing else (still wearing a dress/skirt/etc) at the moment. **There is no compatibility with Chesthole or tilesets that actually display clothing and gear at the moment, at least with custom clothing/weapons/mutations added by this mod.**

----------------------------------------------------------------
**New Professions:**

* **Phantom Gardener:** Close-range killing machine. Knows Niten Ichi-Ryu, and has a katana and wakizashi (can't dual-wield unfortunately). Anything that gets in range of her will die in a flurry of sword slashes, but anything with a gun will utterly ruin her day unless she learns how to use one.
* **Wicked Hermit:** Zombie Zlave master. Can summon friendly zombies and pass through walls via the Probability Travel spell. Befitting her lack of empathy, selfishness, and disrespect for the dead, she starts with the Psychopath trait. Starts with a scalpel.
* **Lunatic Moon Rabbit:** Gunslinger. Proficient in the usage of all firearms and has a targeting Bionic to enhance her accuracy even further. Packs a unique, UPS-powered pistol that can fire in bursts, has a custom-made holster, has a Unified Power System CBM, and has the ability to shoot hostiles with her fingers.
* **Celestial Delinquent:** Made of iron. Resistant to pain and is tough enough to have natural armor. Carries a Sword of Hisou that takes up no space in her inventory until it is summoned into battle.
* **Chief Maid of the SDM:** Time-stopping, knife-throwing maid. Has several throwing knives, and a Time Dilation CBM.
* **Moon Rabbit Recruit:** Lunar Defense Corps Trainee and royal pet of the Watatsuki family. Not quite as proficent in the usage of firearms compared to the Lunatic Moon Rabbit. Has a teleportation CBM, a downgraded ability to shoot hostiles with her fingers, and a special Lunar Rifle with a shoulder strap and bayonet.
* **Oarfish Messenger:** Fancy fighter. Can whip people to death with her scarf and has electricity powers.
* **Hourai Incarnate:** Has knowledge of fire-based magic. Starts with knowledge of Taekwondo (Since the attack descriptions are usually about kicking, which Mokou does in Urban Legend In Limbo), and special talismans that help her resist flames.
* **Lateral-Thinking Kappa:** WIP.

**New Weapons:**

* **Sword of Hisou:** A golden Jian that takes up no space until it is summoned into battle. Works similarly to an expandable baton.
* **Lunatic Pistol:** Burst-fire UPS pistol based off of Reisen Udongein Inaba's gun from Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom, the PS4 port of Urban Legend in Limbo, and Antinomy of Common Flowers. Does not turn into a shotgun at the moment, despite Reisen's gun having that ability in ULIL.
* **Lunar Rifle:** Standard-issue UPS-powered rifle of the Lunar Defense Corps that is far more efficient than a man-made one due to the power of Lunarian science. Comes with an integrated bayonet.

**New Bionics:**

* **Finger Burst CBM:** Shoot a five-round burst with your finger. Lunatic Moon Rabbit spawns with this.
* **Finger Gun CBM:** Shoot a real bullet with your finger. Downgraded version of Finger Burst. Moon Rabbit Recruit spawns with this.

**New Scenarios:**
* **Touhou:** All Touhou professions are playable. Greatly expanded range of starting locations, ranging from a FEMA camp to a gunstore to a LMOE shelter.

**New Monsters:**
* **Moon Rabbit:** WIP.
